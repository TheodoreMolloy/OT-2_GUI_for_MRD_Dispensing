# OT-2_GUI_for_MRD_Dispensing
A GUI to select between different parameters and load a respective program onto the Opentrons OT-2 without the use of the Opentrons app.
This interface was designed for a specific dispensing task based on the lab I worked for. However, the API functions are very adaptable, and the GUI can be relatively easily modified to suit other needs.

## Features
- Upload protocols to OT-2
- Can choose protocol based on various parameters - easily changable to suit different needs.
- Start, pause, resume, and stop runs
- GUI built with PyQt and PySide6

## A note about AI usage
Whilst I don't use AI in educational projects, this was programmed in a work environment on work time, thus I, working alone, couldn't justify not using AI to prioritise company time on getting the project working sooner - particularly for lengthy GUI customisations. However, main logic was developed by me, all code has been read through and fully understood.
